==============
Implementing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture requires combining both retrieval-based and generative-based approaches. In this case, youâ€™ll be using Llama 2, Langchain, and tools like Qwak, Python, and Streamlit to build a robust chatbot solution. The goal is to create a chatbot that can not only generate responses based on the input but also retrieve information from a vector store and use it to augment its responses. The end result is a more powerful AI chatbot capable of answering questions by referencing a rich corpus of data.
Key Steps for Implementing the RAG Architecture:

    Vectorization and Indexing: We first need to vectorize the data (e.g., documents, FAQs, knowledge base) and store them in a vector store.
    Retrieval Mechanism: We will use a vector search mechanism to retrieve the most relevant information from the store based on the query.
    Generative Model: A large language model (LLM) like Llama 2 will be used to generate responses based on both the retrieved data and the user query.
    Integration: Integrate the retrieval system and generative model to form a cohesive chatbot.

Required Libraries and Setup:

    Llama 2 for generating responses.
    Langchain for chaining various components (retrieval and generation).
    Qwak for model deployment.
    Streamlit for creating the chat UI.
    FAISS or Pinecone for vector storage and similarity search.

High-Level Steps:

    Data Ingestion: Upload the data to a vector store (FAISS or Pinecone).
    Data Vectorization: Convert the data into vector representations using a pre-trained model.
    Retrieval: Use the vector store to retrieve the most relevant documents.
    Generative Model: Use Llama 2 or OpenAI to generate responses based on retrieved documents.
    Chat Interface: Create a simple user interface using Streamlit.

Step-by-Step Python Implementation:

    Install Dependencies:

pip install llama-index langchain pinecone-client openai faiss-cpu streamlit transformers

    Set Up Vector Store (FAISS or Pinecone):

import faiss
import numpy as np
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationalChain
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool, AgentType
import openai

# Initialize OpenAI API (if using OpenAI)
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

# Example: Set up FAISS vector store
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()  # You can choose your embedding model here (OpenAI, Mistral, etc.)

# Let's assume we have a corpus of text (e.g., documents, FAQ, knowledge base)
documents = [
    "Document 1: Details about product features.",
    "Document 2: Information about company policies.",
    "Document 3: User manuals and technical details."
]

# Vectorize documents and store in FAISS
vectors = [embedding.embed(doc) for doc in documents]
vectors = np.array(vectors).astype('float32')

# Create FAISS index
dimension = vectors.shape[1]  # Get the dimension of the embedding vectors
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
index.add(vectors)

# Create a Langchain FAISS vector store
vector_store = FAISS(index=index, embedding_function=embedding.embed)

    Retrieving Documents:

# Function to query the vector store
def retrieve_relevant_documents(query):
    query_vector = embedding.embed(query)
    query_vector = np.array(query_vector).astype('float32')
    
    # Perform the search on the FAISS index
    D, I = index.search(query_vector, k=3)  # Retrieve top 3 documents
    relevant_documents = [documents[i] for i in I[0]]
    
    return relevant_documents

    Generative Model (Llama 2 or OpenAI):

from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

# Load Llama 2 model and tokenizer
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("llama-2-7b")
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("llama-2-7b")

def generate_response(prompt):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=200)
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Alternatively, using OpenAI's GPT model for generation
def openai_generate_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

    Combining Retrieval and Generation:

def generate_chatbot_response(query):
    # Retrieve relevant documents from the vector store
    relevant_docs = retrieve_relevant_documents(query)
    
    # Combine the documents with the query to provide context for the model
    context = "\n".join(relevant_docs) + "\n\nUser Query: " + query
    
    # Generate a response using the generative model
    response = openai_generate_response(context)
    return response

    Creating Chat UI with Streamlit:

import streamlit as st

# Initialize the Streamlit app
st.title("AI-Powered Chatbot")

# Input field for the user query
user_query = st.text_input("Ask me anything:", "")

# Button to submit the query
if st.button('Submit'):
    if user_query:
        # Get the response from the RAG model
        response = generate_chatbot_response(user_query)
        st.write(f"Chatbot: {response}")
    else:
        st.write("Please enter a query.")

7. Deployment and Endpoint Configuration:

    To deploy this solution, you can use Qwak or Streamlit Cloud for hosting the web app.
    Ensure that you set up the necessary endpoints for interacting with the model and vector store.

Deployment with Qwak:

You can deploy your model via Qwak using their deployment API to manage model versioning and scaling.

import qwak
from qwak import Model

# Deploy your model on Qwak platform
qwak_client = qwak.Client()

# Initialize your deployed model
model = qwak_client.create_model(
    model_name="chatbot_model",
    model_instance=model,
    framework="huggingface",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Make predictions
response = model.predict({"query": "What's the latest news about Web3?"})
print(response)

Final Notes:

    Data and Storage: Ensure that your vector store is scalable. You can also look into managed vector stores like Pinecone if you're handling large datasets.
    Customization: Depending on your proprietary data, you may want to fine-tune the Llama 2 or OpenAI models on your own dataset.
    Security: Ensure that API keys and sensitive information are securely handled.
    Performance: Fine-tune the vector search and model inference processes to ensure that the chatbot responds quickly.

This code provides a complete flow to build a RAG-based architecture for a chatbot using retrieval from a vector store and generative responses with Llama 2 or OpenAI models. You can further extend this system by incorporating more advanced NLP capabilities and deploying it in a scalable environment for production use.
